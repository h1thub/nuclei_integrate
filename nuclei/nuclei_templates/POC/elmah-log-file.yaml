  description: |
    ELMAH (Error Logging Modules and Handlers) is an application-wide error logging facility that is completely pluggable. It can be dynamically added to a running ASP.NET web application, or even all ASP.NET web applications on a machine, without any need for re-compilation or re-deployment. In some cases, the logs expose ASPXAUTH cookies allowing to hijack a logged in administrator session.
